# The Importance of Application Design 

## Task 

In August 2021 our team got a new and exciting assignment to re-create the already existing application called Proactive Dashboard which is an application that is used to monitor the portfolio by registered and regularly executed queries. Beside creating a new application using cutting-edge technologies the team also had to add new functionalities to it. 

## Design Analysis 

Users from financial departments often have to work with applications that are relatively old, not user friendly and sometimes even overcomplicated meaning that the understanding/learning process could be quite challenging for the users. One of the reasons of this is that during the development process of such applications the design and user experience were not the top priorities which is understandable in a financial IT department. Another reason could be that the importance and (I believe) the role of application design changed in the past years. One way or another, we can assert that having a bad application design could lead to a steep learning curve and cost the company money. 

## Goals 

Considering the above analysis I've decided that we will focus a bit more on the design and I started to define the following goals: 

1. The new design should be based on the old design so that the users who are already familiar with the original design will feel comfortable when using the application. On the other hand, the new users should have an exceptional experience that has a grip on them. 

2. The new design should be inpiring, simple yet remarkable. My personal goal was to create a design that also reminds the users on an actual dashboard, as I wanted the users to feel that they are in full control of the application. 

## Inpiring Design 

An application with a modern user interface can motivate or at least not demotivate the users to work with it. A motivated user works more effectively, they could also come up with new and creative ideas. There is also a chance that a thriving community gets developed around the app. 

## Simple Design 

I read somewhere that explaining the design of your app is like explaining a joke to someoone. I totally agree with this statement. Moreover, I don't know too many people who like to read manuals. When designing an app it's really important to apply the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid). A simple design could shorten the learning curve and it follows logically from this that it also saves money to the company in the long term.  

I also would like to mention the persuasive design technique which I believe is related to this topic at some degree and the application of it can also shorten the learning curve.  

## Remarkable Design 

We want to provide an exceptional user experience that could also urge the users to form a community. You want to leave a positive impact on the users so that the chance that the clients will choose you for their next project increases. 

## Back to Proactive Dashboard 

When we started to work on the application the first question was whether we want to stick to the Carbon Design System. We worked with that CSS framework in many other projects. It’s perfectly suitable to a financial app, but we wanted to create something different this time. Moreover, in the original application the main component which was the workitem component was round and in Carbon DS you can’t find too many rounded shapes. The final decision was that we will step out of our comfort zone and create a unique design for this application. 

We stuck to the color palette that we built at the very beginning, we created base animations (even a custom loading animation) to make the app more vivid and smooth, we created custom components using rounded shapes and animations. 

In the end I think that we were able to create a unique, cool looking, modern application and even achieve the goals above. Beside that we were able to cover all the requirements that have been requested by the client. 

## Conclusion 

Beside design the functionality of an application is definitely more important. I believe that the most impotant criteria should be for all applications to add value to the users. The application should be a complete solution not a workaround, however, I believe that spending some time on developing a well thought-out design can be beneficial on the long term.
